AE FOR CREDIT:
- Confirm that the digits are able to be reconstructed in the bottleneck 
    - Make sure to leave the gif inside your notebook so we can see it! DONE

    - Make a few notes below talking about whether or not this is interesting and/or useful:
    I think it kind of interesting because the result will not change the basic shapes of the reconstructed pictures. They are the same as the original ones. However, compared with original ones, the reconstructed pictures lost some fine-grained features. As a result, I think this technique is probably useful in image compression.
