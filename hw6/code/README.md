AE FOR CREDIT:
- Confirm that the digits are able to be reconstructed in the bottleneck 
    - Make sure to leave the gif inside your notebook so we can see it! DONE
    - Make a few notes below talking about whether or not this is interesting and/or useful.
    I think it kind of interesting because the result will not change the basic shapes of the reconstructed pictures. They are the same as the original ones. However, compared with original ones, the reconstructed pictures lost some fine-grained features. As a result, I think this technique is probably useful in image compression.
- Confirm that the latent encoding's decomposition roughly matches with original data's. 
    - Run the visualization code below and leave it in your output. DONE
    - Comment a bit on it. Is this a good sign? Does it have any use?
    the latent encoding's decomposition roughly matches with original data's. This is a good sign. Maybe it can be used in image compression.

VAE FOR CREDIT:
- Make sure both of your gifs are present in the notebook! DONE

- Talk about a potential application that you think it would be cool to applied VAEs to:
For applications in finance (which is relatively new), VAEs are used to generate synthetic volatility surfaces for options trading.
Bio-signal applications of VAE include detection of serious diseases using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, data augmentation of bio-signals and improving electroencephalography (EEG)-based speech recognition systems, etc.
